### Notes
Some challenges I faces was learning how to really use Github since I started working on different devices. Another major challenge I faces was learning how to read exceptions and see why the compiler was complaining. I learned the importance of using the correct subclasses when making a new file because the compiler was expecting one type but I had made another type all in all I learned alot and if it wasn't for school and personal life I would've added more to my app I honestly found it very fun.
